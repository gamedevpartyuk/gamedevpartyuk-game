html5game-skeleton
------------------

This is my attempt of a game library/kickstart.

Right now using an abstraction library for Box2D/Chipmunk with the bare minimum.

Notes
-----

- Sprites can be edited with Pixen, but should be saved as image series
- Maps can be edited with Tiled, and must be exported as JSON
- Tilesets defined inside maps are imported and added to the structure in 'sprite-definitions.js'

Pending
- Polygon implementation in the abstraction layer.
- More testing with Chipmunk-js
